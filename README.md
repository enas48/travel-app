#travel planner App Project

## Overview

This project is to create travel app that, at a minimum, obtains a desired trip location & date from the user, and displays weather and an image of the location using information obtained from external APIs.

## instructions

once you clone, you will still need to install everything:

`cd` into your new folder and run:

- `npm install`

start the app with :

- `npm run start`
- app run on `localhost:3000`


Ways to Stand Out sections have been added:

- Add end date and display length of trip.
- Pull in an image for the country from Pixabay API when the entered location brings up no results.
- Integrate the REST Countries API to pull in data for the country being visited.
- pull the forecast for multiple days.
- Incorporate icons into forecast.
