Ways to Stand Out sections have been added:

- Add end date and display length of trip.
- Pull in an image for the country from Pixabay API when the entered location brings up no results.
- Integrate the REST Countries API to pull in data for the country being visited.
- pull the forecast for multiple days.
- Incorporate icons into forecast.
